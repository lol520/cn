Damage Calculations are based on the target's current state without putting into consideration their skills, shields, summoner spells, item shields.

This includes barriers, heal, spell shields (morgana's shield), items with shields (banshee's), skills that block skills (sivir's,viktor's) , sudden hp/mdef gain (alistar's SS and nasus's)

Please do consider this before engaging in a fight.
